The aim of the research was to identify Requirements Engineering practices used in organizations that develop Web applications and investigate the use of such practices in such applications. The information from the interviews was captured by a Web-based questionnaire answered. The sample was constructed by the snowball method. 47 valid responses from as many companies in the local market were obtained. The scope of information obtained includes the processes of elicitation, specification and validation as well as aspects of requirements management. The results show the predominance of traditional elicitation techniques over the most recent and most promising penetration validation techniques. Negotiation techniques and prioritization of requirements have higher penetration in smaller companies. Meanwhile processes change control requirements have greater penetration in larger companies.},

In Web applications, usability requirements are the most important type of non-functional requirements because they determine the acceptability of such applications. Nevertheless, usability requirements are usually forgotten or unconsidered, which increases the cost of their development and the cost of fixing usability problems. This paper presents the research agenda for the development of a set of technologies for the elicitation and specification of usability requirements for Web applications. We will propose and develop a set of techniques and a tool support that will allow software engineers to produce descriptive requirements specifications. Such specifications will guide the development team through the implementation of Web applications meeting usability principals. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the techniques and tool; identify improvement opportunities; and safely apply the technologies in the industry, we will evaluate the technologies through empirical studies.},

            The recent European legislation emphasizes the importance of enabling people with disabilities to have access to online information and services of public sector bodies. To this regard, automatic evaluation and monitoring of Web accessibility can play a key role for various stakeholders involved in creating and maintaining over time accessible products. In this paper we present the results of elicitation activities that we carried out in a European project to collect experience and feedback from Web commissioners, developers and content authors of websites and web applications. The purpose was to understand their current practices in addressing accessibility issues, identify the barriers they encounter when exploiting automatic support in ensuring the accessibility of Web resources, and receive indications about what functionalities they would like to exploit in order to better manage accessibility evaluation and monitoring.},

	abstract = {The complexity of software projects as well as the multidisciplinary nature of requirements engineering (RE) requires developers to carefully select RE techniques and practices during software development. Nevertheless, the selection of RE techniques is usually based on personal preference or existing company practice rather than on characteristics of the project at hand. Furthermore, there is a lack of guidance on which techniques are suitable for a certain project context. So far, only a limited amount of research has been done regarding the selection of RE techniques based on the attributes of the project under development. The few approaches that currently exist for the selection of RE techniques provide only little guidance for the actual selection process. We believe that the evaluation of RE techniques in the context of an application domain and a specific project is of great importance. This paper describes a Methodology for Requirements Engineering Techniques Selection (MRETS) as an approach that helps requirements engineers select suitable RE techniques for the project at hand. The MRETS has three aspects: Firstly, it aids requirements engineers in establishing a link between the attributes of the project and the attributes of RE techniques. Secondly, based on the evaluation schema proposed in our research, MRETS provides an opportunity to analyze RE techniques in detail using clustering. Thirdly, the objective function used in our approach provides an effective decision support mechanism for the selection of RE techniques. This paper makes contributions to RE techniques analysis, the application of RE techniques in practice, RE research, and software engineering in general. The application of the proposed methodology to an industrial project provides preliminary information on the effectiveness of MRETS for the selection of RE techniques.},

A more emergent and collaborative view of requirements elicitation and communication is required to encompass the user, contextual and organisational factors. From this accompanying literature in communication issues in requirements elicitation, a four-dimensional framework is outlined and used to appraise comparatively four different methodologies seeking to promote a closer working relationship between users and designers. The facilitation of communication between users and designers is subject to discussion of the ways in which communicative activities can be ‘optimised’ for successful requirements gathering, by making recommendations based on the four dimensions to provide fruitful considerations for system designers.},

	abstract = {Context
There are several methods to elicit requirements through interviews between an end-user and a team of software developers. The choice of the best method in this context is usually on subjective developers’ preferences instead of objective reasons. There is a lack of empirical evaluations of methods to elicit requirements that help developers to choose the most suitable one.
Objective
This paper designs and conducts a family of experiments to compare three methods to elicit requirements: Unstructured Interviews, where there is no specific protocol or artifacts; Joint Application Design (JAD), where each member of the development team has a specific role; Paper Prototyping, where developers contrast the requirements with the end-user through prototypes.
Method
The experiment is a between-subjects design with next response variables: number of requirements, time, diversity, completeness, quality and performance. The experiment consists of a maximum of 4 rounds of interviews between students that play the role of developers and an instructor that plays the role of client. Subjects had to elaborate a requirements specification document as results of the interviews. We recruited 167 subjects in 4 replications in 3 years. Subjects were gathered in development teams of 6 developers at most, and each team was an experimental unit.
Results
We found some significant differences. Paper Prototyping yields the best results to elicit as many requirements as possible, JAD requires the highest time to report the requirements and the least overlapping, and Unstructured Interviews yields the highest overlapping and the lowest time to report the requirements.
Conclusions
Paper Prototyping is the most suitable for eliciting functional requirements, JAD is the most suitable for non-functional requirements and to avoid overlapping, Unstructured Interviews is the fastest but with poor quality in the results.},

Tasks such as the requirements elicitation, the specification of requirements or the requirements validation are essential to assure the quality of the resulting software. The development of Web systems usually involves more heterogeneous stakeholders than the construction of traditional software. In addition, Web systems have additional requirements for the navigational and multimedia aspects as well as for the usability as no training is possible. Therefore a thoroughly requirements analysis is even more relevant. In contrast, most of the methodologies that have been proposed for the development of Web applications focus on the design paying less attention to the requirements engineering.

	abstract = {A requirement elicitation is a task that helps a customer to define what is required, and then worked out with great care and nicety of detail. This paper surveys and evaluates some methods for eliciting requirements of computer based systems, what are the categories of these methods, what are the problems that each method involves. the solution of one method leads us to the next method so these methods are interrelated with each other .to avoid problems in one method we need another method so we can say combination of different methods can be used to elicited specific requirements. The insufficient requirements engineering process forms one important factor that cause the failure of an IT project. We elaborate a comparison of requirements development methods, evaluation criteria and also identify common factors that affect the method selection. Requirements are elicited through consultation with stakeholders so it certainly seems simple enough, But isn’t simple it is very hard.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a systematic review of empirical studies concerning the effectiveness of elicitation techniques, and the subsequent aggregation of empirical evidence gathered from those studies. The most significant results of the aggregation process are as follows: (I) interviews, preferentially structured, appear to be one of the most effective elicitation techniques; (2) many techniques often cited in the literature, like card sorting, ranking or thinking aloud, tend to be less effective than interviews; (3) analyst experience does not appear to be a relevant factor; and (4) the studies conducted have not found the use of intermediate representations during elicitation to have significant positive effects. It should be noted that, as a general rule, the studies from which these results were aggregated have not been replicated, and therefore the above claims cannot be said to be absolutely certain. However, they can be used by researchers as pieces of knowledge to be further investigated and by practitioners in development projects, always taking into account that they are preliminary findings},

	abstract = {Requirements Engineering Processes and Techniques Why this book was written The value of introducing requirements engineering to trainee software engineers is to equip them for the real world of software and systems development. What is involved in Requirements Engineering? As a discipline, newly emerging from software engineering, there are a range of views on where requirements engineering starts and finishes and what it should encompass. This book offers the most comprehensive coverage of the requirements engineering process to date - from initial requirements elicitation through to requirements validation. How and Which methods and techniques should you use? As there is no one catch-all technique applicable to all types of system, requirements engineers need to know about a range of different techniques. Tried and tested techniques such as data-flow and object-oriented models are covered as well as some promising new ones. They are all based on real systems descriptions to demonstrate the applicability of the approach. Who should read it? Principally written for senior undergraduate and graduate students studying computer science, software engineering or systems engineering, this text will also be helpful for those in industry new to requirements engineering.
