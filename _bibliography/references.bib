	abstract = {Abstract. Since the outset of our research, we have been looking for ways to help software companies develop software systems for which regulatory compliance is a key quality attribute. This is because many regulations, laws, standards, and other authoritative rules have a direct impact on the way software systems, used by regulated organizations, are developed, tested, and maintained. In this paper, we particularly discuss the impact of regulatory compliance on software development practices. We achieve this by discussing how regulations and laws impact three main aspects of software which are: product, process, and project. We argue that there is a need for a new field of study that we refer to as software compliance engineering and which aims to investigate techniques and tools for the development and maintenance of auditable software systems.},

This Article explores this problem through a series of case studies and articulates a taxonomy of code regulations to help place hardware-turned-code rules in context. The Article considers the likely turf wars, regulatory thickets, and related dynamics that are likely to arise, and closes by considering the benefits of creating a new agency with some degree of centralized authority over software regulation issues.},

The concepts described within this paper can be utilized by medical device manufacturers in order to establish a cybersecurity program as part of their quality management systems. In general, there are three complementary ways based on the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) cybersecurity framework that can be used to remove gaps in the organization’s cybersecurity. The first way focuses on designing software products that take cybersecurity into account (i.e., prevention). The second way is to perform security and penetration testing and to apply other cybersecurity controls to reduce attacks and vulnerabilities that could be exploited (i.e., detection). The third way emphasizes maintenance plan in case of a cyberattack (i.e., response and recovery).},

	abstract = {In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, the principles of DevOps have transcended industry boundaries, bringing transformative changes from FinTech to healthcare. This journey across industries showcases how DevOps practices, originally honed in the fast-paced world of financial technology, are now being adapted to meet the rigorous demands of the healthcare sector. The shift is not just about technology; it's about culture, collaboration, and continuous improvement. In FinTech, where speed, security, and compliance are paramount, DevOps has enabled organizations to innovate quickly while maintaining stringent regulatory standards. As these practices migrate into healthcare, they are reshaping the way hospitals, clinics, and health-tech companies operate, emphasizing patient safety, data privacy, and system reliability. The journey is marked by challenges unique to each field—from the financial sector’s need for rapid deployment and resilience under pressure to healthcare’s focus on compliance with healthcare regulations and ensuring uninterrupted patient care. However, the core principles of DevOps—automation, continuous delivery, and a culture of collaboration—remain consistent, proving that these methodologies can be as effective in improving patient outcomes as they are in driving financial performance. This cross-industry exploration not only highlights the versatility of DevOps but also illustrates the broader impact of this approach, showing how it can drive innovation, improve efficiencies, and foster a culture of continuous improvement across diverse fields. Ultimately, the DevOps journey from FinTech to healthcare is a testament to the adaptability and power of these practices, offering valuable insights for organizations looking to harness the full potential of DevOps, regardless of their industry.},

The aim of the research was to identify Requirements Engineering practices used in organizations that develop Web applications and investigate the use of such practices in such applications. The information from the interviews was captured by a Web-based questionnaire answered. The sample was constructed by the snowball method. 47 valid responses from as many companies in the local market were obtained. The scope of information obtained includes the processes of elicitation, specification and validation as well as aspects of requirements management. The results show the predominance of traditional elicitation techniques over the most recent and most promising penetration validation techniques.

This paper presents the research agenda for the development of a set of technologies for the elicitation and specification of usability requirements for Web applications. We will propose and develop a set of techniques and a tool support that will allow software engineers to produce descriptive requirements specifications. Such specifications will guide the development team through the implementation of Web applications meeting usability principals.

            The recent European legislation emphasizes the importance of enabling people with disabilities to have access to online information and services of public sector bodies. To this regard, automatic evaluation and monitoring of Web accessibility can play a key role for various stakeholders involved in creating and maintaining over time accessible products. In this paper we present the results of elicitation activities that we carried out in a European project to collect experience and feedback from Web commissioners, developers and content authors of websites and web applications. The purpose was to understand their current practices in addressing accessibility issues, identify the barriers they encounter when exploiting automatic support in ensuring the accessibility of Web resources, and receive indications about what functionalities they would like to exploit in order to better manage accessibility evaluation and monitoring.},

	abstract = {The complexity of software projects as well as the multidisciplinary nature of requirements engineering (RE) requires developers to carefully select RE techniques and practices during software development. Nevertheless, the selection of RE techniques is usually based on personal preference or existing company practice rather than on characteristics of the project at hand. Furthermore, there is a lack of guidance on which techniques are suitable for a certain project context. So far, only a limited amount of research has been done regarding the selection of RE techniques based on the attributes of the project under development. The few approaches that currently exist for the selection of RE techniques provide only little guidance for the actual selection process. We believe that the evaluation of RE techniques in the context of an application domain and a specific project is of great importance. This paper describes a Methodology for Requirements Engineering Techniques Selection (MRETS) as an approach that helps requirements engineers select suitable RE techniques for the project at hand. The MRETS has three aspects: Firstly, it aids requirements engineers in establishing a link between the attributes of the project and the attributes of RE techniques. Secondly, based on the evaluation schema proposed in our research, MRETS provides an opportunity to analyze RE techniques in detail using clustering. Thirdly, the objective function used in our approach provides an effective decision support mechanism for the selection of RE techniques. This paper makes contributions to RE techniques analysis, the application of RE techniques in practice, RE research, and software engineering in general. The application of the proposed methodology to an industrial project provides preliminary information on the effectiveness of MRETS for the selection of RE techniques.},

	abstract = {The elicitation or communication of user requirements comprises an early and critical but highly error-prone stage in system development. Socially oriented methodologies provide more support for user involvement in design than the rigidity of more traditional methods, facilitating the degree of user–designer communication and the ‘capture’ of requirements. A more emergent and collaborative view of requirements elicitation and communication is required to encompass the user, contextual and organisational factors. From this accompanying literature in communication issues in requirements elicitation, a four-dimensional framework is outlined and used to appraise comparatively four different methodologies seeking to promote a closer working relationship between users and designers. The facilitation of communication between users and designers is subject to discussion of the ways in which communicative activities can be ‘optimised’ for successful requirements gathering, by making recommendations based on the four dimensions to provide fruitful considerations for system designers.},

	abstract = {Context
There are several methods to elicit requirements through interviews between an end-user and a team of software developers. The choice of the best method in this context is usually on subjective developers’ preferences instead of objective reasons. There is a lack of empirical evaluations of methods to elicit requirements that help developers to choose the most suitable one.
Objective
This paper designs and conducts a family of experiments to compare three methods to elicit requirements: Unstructured Interviews, where there is no specific protocol or artifacts; Joint Application Design (JAD), where each member of the development team has a specific role; Paper Prototyping, where developers contrast the requirements with the end-user through prototypes.
Method
The experiment is a between-subjects design with next response variables: number of requirements, time, diversity, completeness, quality and performance. The experiment consists of a maximum of 4 rounds of interviews between students that play the role of developers and an instructor that plays the role of client. Subjects had to elaborate a requirements specification document as results of the interviews. We recruited 167 subjects in 4 replications in 3 years. Subjects were gathered in development teams of 6 developers at most, and each team was an experimental unit.
Results
We found some significant differences. Paper Prototyping yields the best results to elicit as many requirements as possible, JAD requires the highest time to report the requirements and the least overlapping, and Unstructured Interviews yields the highest overlapping and the lowest time to report the requirements.
Conclusions
Paper Prototyping is the most suitable for eliciting functional requirements, JAD is the most suitable for non-functional requirements and to avoid overlapping, Unstructured Interviews is the fastest but with poor quality in the results.},

The paper compares a selection of eight techniques used in requirements elicitation. The techniques are evaluated according to six qualitative criteria with a focus on the terms of information collection and the qualities of that information. The qualitative results are illustrated through net-diagrams that can be used to further argue on the techniques, especially in areas where requirements for individual users need to be elicited.},

	abstract = {The requirements engineering discipline has become more and more important in the last years. Tasks such as the requirements elicitation, the specification of requirements or the requirements validation are essential to assure the quality of the resulting software. The development of Web systems usually involves more heterogeneous stakeholders than the construction of traditional software. In addition, Web systems have additional requirements for the navigational and multimedia aspects as well as for the usability as no training is possible. Therefore a thoroughly requirements analysis is even more relevant. In contrast, most of the methodologies that have been proposed for the development of Web applications focus on the design paying less attention to the requirements engineering. This paper is a comparative study of the requirements handling in Web methodologies showing trends in the use of techniques for capturing, specifying and validating Web requirements.

The insufficient requirements engineering process forms one important factor that cause the failure of an IT project.

The most significant results of the aggregation process are as follows: (I) interviews, preferentially structured, appear to be one of the most effective elicitation techniques; (2) many techniques often cited in the literature, like card sorting, ranking or thinking aloud, tend to be less effective than interviews; (3) analyst experience does not appear to be a relevant factor; and (4) the studies conducted have not found the use of intermediate representations during elicitation to have significant positive effects. It should be noted that, as a general rule, the studies from which these results were aggregated have not been replicated, and therefore the above claims cannot be said to be absolutely certain. However, they can be used by researchers as pieces of knowledge to be further investigated and by practitioners in development projects, always taking into account that they are preliminary findings},
