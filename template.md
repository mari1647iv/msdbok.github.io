*Author: Marina Ivanova, Innopolis University, Innopolis, Russia  (<m.ivanova@innopolis.university>) üë§*

*Year: 2024*

### Abstract üìù

This paper aims to overview the most used in web application development requirement elicitation techniques and identify the most effective techniques to capture web applications requirements.  The research will focus on the identification of the most relevant and crucial requirements for the web applications, overview the ability to capture these requirements and conduct the comparative analysis of the most popular and used in web development requirements elicitation techniques. Finally, the most relevant and well-fit techniques are highlighted to be further recommended for usage in frontend-focused web applications development

## 1. Introduction üìñ

### 1.1 Motivation üí°

With respect to the continuous demand for user-oriented web applications, the ability to accurately identify web and, in particular, frontend requirements is increasing significantly. The nature of web interfaces playing the role of middleware between users and the variety of different services and software causes their diverse applications and requirements, while unified in the specifics of the online systems. Moreover, the usability aspect, as usually implied, but not verbally defined non-functional requirement can be left uncaptured or uncharacterized, lacking measurable acceptance criterias. Efficient requirement gathering processes can help to shorten the development cycle and achieve better alignment with user expectations. In this context, it is highly important for the project success to choose the best-fit requirements gathering techniques, that are able to capture the requirements, most-likely to be met in web development. 

### 1.2 Problem Statement ‚ùì

TBD: The specificity of web application requirements and difficulty of overcoming challenges of elicitation process specific to the WebDev domain.

### 1.3 Objectives :dart:

The objective of the research can be formulated via the GQM Goal Template. This study aims:


> **to analyse**	existing requirements elicitation techniques \
> **for the purpose of**	their comparative assessment \
> **with respect to**	their ability to capture relevant requirements \
> **from the viewpoint of**	software engineer \
> **in the context of**	web applications development.

The following research questions were derived from this goal:

> **RQ1:** Which requirements are relevant in the context of web applications development? \
> **RQ2:** How to assess the ability of requirements elicitation technique to capture chosen requirements? \
> **RQ3:** Which requirements elicitation techniques should be chosen for the comparative analysis? \
> **RQ4:** Which of the chosen requirements elicitation techniques are the most and less useful to capture relevant requirements in the context of web applications development?

## 3. Requirements Elicitation Techniques Overview üîé

Now let me focus on each of the mentioned above requirements elicitation technique and analyse its strong and weak ponts.

### 3.1 Interview
TBD: Characterisation of the Interview technique and analysis of the technique advantages and disadvantages.
The most common and direct requirements analysis techniques is interview with the customer. The development team and the customer or his representatives conducts the meeting in order to clarify the project, its mission and create the common vision. While it is one of the most popular and, one may say, even obliatory, it may have a series of flows due to the speaking format of the meeting, that is a perfect environment for the birth of misunderstandings due to the different background, vocabulary, missed requirements during discussion, etc. One of the common ambiguity, could be born in such discussions due to the webdev vocabulary is the user-frendly UI/UX web interface. For different types of user intuitive interface could mean different things,  therefore if the clear accurate user personas would not be specified during the requirement process, such an definition in the product requirements can cause the difference in expectations for the final result between the frontend developers and the stakeholders.

### 3.2 Brainstorming
TBD: Characterisation of the Brainstorming technique and analysis of the technique advantages and disadvantages.
The next step of the requirements process is the brainstorming technique during which the unclear and unspecified requirements could be clarified. The development team meets with th customers in order to discuss the possibilities in the final process and brainstorm possible solutions.
